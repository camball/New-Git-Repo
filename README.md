# New Git Repo
This is a little script I made to quickly create new GitHub repositories.

I have it on GitHub so I can access it from any computer, but also so it is available for anyone who may want to use it (modify, distribute, etc., however you like; there is no license).

## Setup
1. Assuming you are on a Unix-like system, add it to your path in some way. I just save the file in `/usr/local/bin`, which is already in my path. This allows you to run it from outside its storage directory.
2. Make the file executable by running `chmod u+x git-setup.sh` (so you can run it with `./git-setup.sh` instead of `bash git-setup.sh`).
